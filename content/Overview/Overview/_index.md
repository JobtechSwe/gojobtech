*An open digital infrastructure that enables people to meet. All actors can easily contribute with their data and code - as well as take part of others.*

In order to maximize the efficiency of matching and to stimulate the creation of more digital services, a common digital ecosystem is needed. One where all actors in the labour market share data and collaborate. The more actors who contribute to the ecosystem, private as well as from the public sector,  the better matching and more beneficial effects can be generated. Therefore, we would like to see more players in the labour market join the digital ecosystem, and work towards creating a community of interested parties to engage in the ecosystem. The three groups of participants in a ecosystem, infrastructure builders, developers/organisations , and end-users, have unique needs and motivations for participating in it. The Swedish Public Employment Service are a keyplayer as a infrastrukture builder trying to build a platform for all actors.

### Low barrier to entry

For developers, platforms lower entry barriers by providing a shared foundation to use as a starting point for their own work. They also provide access to a prospective customer pool, which can find and transact with the app developers more easily through the platform than they could without it.

```Components:

1. Jobtech dev    - Sharing assets that is hard to find, build or buy.
2. Jobtech store  - A app store for the labour market end-users
3. Jobtech search - Opensource search service
4. Jobtech jobs   - All jobs aggregated in one place
5. Jobtech myData - Making labour market competences available
```


### Variety of services for end-users

For end-users, platforms can allow extreme levels of customization to their unique needs by enabling them to themselves mix-and-match apps that increase their personal utility of the platform.
