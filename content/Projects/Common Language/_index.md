# Common Language Jobtech Taxonomy

Jobtech taxonomy consists of two main parts. One is the structured standardized information changed via a commity. The most important standard is SSYK  Swedish Standard Classification of Occupations.
The other part is the skills and occupations used job ads. We are using text analysis of million of ads to continously improve the common language.

We are currently develop a new uniform structure of all taxonomy data.
