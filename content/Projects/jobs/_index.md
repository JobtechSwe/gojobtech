We collect information about all jobpostings in Sweden. As a startpoint we use the information about jobs from the Swedish Public Emplyment Service service Platsbanken thats approximate 35% of all jobpostings.  To get information about the rest we cooperate with the Lund based company Auranest. We scan 285 diffetent job sites to get information about 90% all.
The information about all jobs are used in Jobtech serach.

We are continusly working on improving the information.
